I'm an Information Technology student at Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology with a hunger for science. 
I'm learning the best techniques from those of you on LinkedIn and from other sources around the web, and this is 
where I publish my findings.

If you have any question, comments, or anything for me (even if you just want to grab a cup of coffee) don't hesitate to
reach out to me via e-mail, LinkedIn, GitHub, or any other outlet you can find me at. 

Thanks for reading!
